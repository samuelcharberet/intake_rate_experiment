# An intake rate experiment

Nutrient cycling is impacted by animal communities in various ways. One is the consumption of a resource and release of waste. Accelerate vs slowing down. Several individual or species level traits have been shown to affect both the quantity released per unit time and the quality of these wastes.

Here we investigate this link experimentally in a polyphagous insect fed an artificial diet at discrete and restrictive levels. Advantages of the model (easy to rear, wastes represent total digestive and excretory wastes, exuviates are  almost totally consumed allowing in depth mass and nutrient balance studies).
